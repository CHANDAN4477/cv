    <p>TThe Nissan GT-R (Gran Turismo–Racing; model code: R35; Japanese: 日産・GT-R; Nissan GT-R) is a car built by Japanese marque Nissan since 2007. It has a 2+2 seating layout and is considered both a sports car and a grand tourer. The engine is front-mid mounted and drives all four wheels. It succeeds the Nissan Skyline GT-R, a faster variant of the Nissan Skyline. Although this model was the sixth-generation to bear the GT-R name, it is no longer part of the Skyline line-up. The car is built on the PM platform, derived from the FM platform used in the Skyline and Nissan Z models. Production is conducted in a shared production line at Nissan's Tochigi plant in Japan.</p>

    <p>As per Nissan's intention of creating a world beating sports car, the GT-R brand was revived as part of the Nissan Revival Plan. Overall development began in 2000, following seven years of development and testing, including the introduction of two concept models in 2001 and 2005. The production version of the GT-R was unveiled at the 2007 Tokyo Motor Show. The GT-R is a brand-new car built on the PM platform, and featured innovative concepts and technologies, such as advanced aerodynamics, the VR38DETT engine, an active suspension system and the ATTESA E-TS Pro all-wheel-drive system, making it the first ever rear mounted independent transaxle all-wheel-drive vehicle. It is one of the first production cars to feature launch control and a dual-clutch transmission as well. The overall body is made out of steel, aluminium and carbon-fibre. In 2009 it set a record for the fastest accelerating 4-seater production car.</p>
